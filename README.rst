==========
Pynoculars
==========


Module that facilitates monitoring of field variables and method invocations.


Description
===========

It is not difficult to monitor variable changes and method invocations on a case by case basis, none-the-less it obviscates the meaning of the code and directs the attention to superflous lines. Pynoculars explicitly gives a class the capability to monitor when variables change and when methods are invoked; callbacks (both synchronous and asynchronous) are invoked by these changes.
